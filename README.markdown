# mt2jekyll

This project is a collection of three utilities that I wrote to move
my blog from [MovableType](http://movabletype.org) to
[jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master).  

* mt2jekyll - converts a MovableType export into a directory of jekyll
  posts
* mt2disqus - converts the comments in a MovableType export to Disqus
* disqus_import - publishes comments to Disqus from JSON files

Additionally there are two small libraries to assist this code.

* mt.py - MovableType export format parser
* disqus.py - Simple Disqus API wrapper
